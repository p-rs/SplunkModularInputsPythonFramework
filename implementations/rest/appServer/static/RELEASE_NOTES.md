1.3.7
-----
* Added support for token replacement functions in the URL to be able to return a list

URL's will be executed in parallel in multiple threads. See tokens.py

1.3.6
-----

* Added a custom response handler for rolling out generic JSON arrays

1.3.5

HTTP request

1.3.4
-----

* Added support for dynamic token substitution in the endpoint URL

$sometoken$ will get substituted with the output of the 'sometoken' function

-----
* Added support to persist and retrieve cookies

1.3.2
-----
* Changed the logic for persistence of state back to inputs.conf to occur directly after polling/event indexing has completed rather than waiting for the polling loop frequency sleep period to exit. This potentially deals with situations where you might terminate Splunk before the REST Mod Input has persisted state changes back to inputs.conf because it was in a sleep loop during shutdown.
